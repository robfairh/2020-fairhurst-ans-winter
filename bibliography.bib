Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-speciﬁc applications, all built on the same software framework, are efﬁciently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a ﬂexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simpliﬁed Westinghouse AP-1000 conﬁguration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shufﬂe.},

Accurate and validated analysis tools are indeed a crucial requirement for safety analysis and licensing of nuclear reactors. To guide this effort, a numerical benchmark on the MHTGR was created by the NGNP project and formally approved in 2012 for international participation by the OECD/NEA. The benchmark defines a common set of exercises and the comparison of solutions obtained with different analysis tools is expected to improve the understanding of simulation methods for HTGRs. The coupled neutronics/thermal-fluid solution presented in this paper was obtained with the neutron transport Monte Carlo code MCS developed by Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and the thermal-fluid code GAMMA+ developed by Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute. The purpose of this paper is to present the GAMMA+/MCS coupled system, the calculation methodology, and the obtained solutions.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the development of coarse-mesh nodal methods for the numerical solution of the neutron diffusionand transport equations is reviewed.In contrast with earlier nodal simulators, more recent nodal diffusionmethods are characterized by the systematicderivation of spatial coupling relationships that are entirely consistent with the multigroup diffusion equation. These relationships most often are derived by developing approximations to the one-dimensionalequations obtained by integrating the multidimensionaldiffusionequation over directions transverse to each coordinate axis. Both polynomial and analytic approaches to the solution of the transverse-integrated equations are discussed, and the Cartesian-geometry polynomial approach is derived in a manner which motivates the extension of this formulation to the solution of the diffusionequation in hexagonal geometry. Iterative procedures developed for the solution of the nodal equations are discussed briefly, and numerical comparisons for representative three-dimensional benchmark problems are given. The application of similar ideas to the neutron transport equation has led to the development of coarse-mesh transport schemes that combine nodal spatial approximations with angular representations based on either the standard discrete-ordinate approximation or double P, expansions of the angular dependenceof the fluxeson the surfaces of the nodes. The former methods yield improved difference approximations to the multidimensional discrete-ordinates equations, while the latter approach leads to equations similar to those obtained in interfacecurrent nodal-diffusionformulations. The relativeeflicienciesof these two approaches are discussed,and directions for future work are indicated.},

Motivation for the work is provided via analysis and numerical experiments on simpler multiphysics reactor models. We then provide detail of the physical models and numerical methods in PRONGHORN.

This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution ﬁelds than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

	abstract = {The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is tasked with the development of reactor physics analysis capability of the Next Generation Nuclear Power (NGNP) project. In order to examine the INL’s current prismatic reactor analysis tools, the project is conducting a benchmark exercise based on modeling the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR). This exercise entails the development of a model for the initial criticality, a 19 fuel column thin annular core, and the fully loaded core critical condition with 30 fuel columns. Special emphasis is devoted to physical phenomena and artifacts in HTTR that are similar to phenomena and artifacts in the NGNP base design. The DRAGON code is used in this study since it offers significant ease and versatility in modeling prismatic designs. DRAGON can generate transport solutions via Collision Probability (CP), Method of Characteristics (MOC) and Discrete Ordinates (Sn). A fine group cross-section library based on the SHEM 281 energy structure is used in the DRAGON calculations. The results from this study show reasonable agreement in the calculation of the core multiplication factor with the MC methods, but a consistent bias of 2–3\% with the experimental values is obtained. This systematic error has also been observed in other HTTR benchmark efforts and is well documented in the literature. The ENDF/B VII graphite and U235 cross sections appear to be the main source of the error. The isothermal temperature coefficients calculated with the fully loaded core configuration agree well with other benchmark participants but are 40\% higher than the experimental values. This discrepancy with the measurement partially stems from the fact that during the experiments the control rods were adjusted to maintain criticality, whereas in the model, the rod positions were fixed. In addition, this work includes a brief study of a cross section generation approach that seeks to decouple the domain in order to account for neighbor effects. This spectral interpenetration is a dominant effect in annular HTR physics. This analysis methodology should be further explored in order to reduce the error that is systematically propagated in the traditional generation of cross sections.},

The accuracy of the nodal diffusion and transport approximations is demonstrated by comparison with conventional finite difference methods and Monte Carlo calculations for a number of mathematical benchmark problems. Based on numerical results, it is concluded that the code HEXNOD is well suited for three-dimensional routine analysis of fast reactors and, in particular, as the neutronics module of the generalized quasi-static kinetics program HEXNODYN, which is currently being developed as part of the European accident code EAC-2.},

A linear or bilinear ﬁnite element formulation for the reactor core and a linear boundary element technique for the reﬂector which are combined through interface continuity conditions constitute the basis of the developed method. The present formulation is restricted to two-dimensional geometries and has been implemented in the developed computer program. Via comparisons with analytical solutions, the proposed method has been validated. Further comparisons against the pure ﬁnite and boundary element formulations show that the proposed method constitutes a viable alternative for the numerical solution of neutron diﬀusion problems of both the external neutron source and multiplication eigenvalue determination variety.},

Linear approximation of shape functions in the GFEM with unstructured tetrahedron elements is used in the calculation. Both criticality and ﬁxed source calculations may be performed using the developed GFEM-3D computational code. An acceptable level of accuracy at a low computational cost is the main advantage of applying the unstructured tetrahedron elements. The unstructured tetrahedron elements generated with Gambit software are used in the GFEM-3D computational code through a developed interface. The forward/adjoint multiplication factor, forward/adjoint ﬂux distribution, and power distribution in the reactor core are calculated using the power iteration method. Criticality calculations are benchmarked against the valid solution of the neutron diffusion equation for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-3D and Water-Water Energetic Reactor (VVER)-1000 reactor cores. In addition, validation of the calculations against the P1 approximation of the transport theory is investigated in relation to the liquid metal fast breeder reactor benchmark problem. The neutron ﬁxed source calculations are benchmarked through a comparison with the results obtained from similar computational codes. Finally, an analysis of the sensitivity of calculations to the number of elements is performed.},

This paper presents a state-of-the-art AMR algorithm applied to the multigroup neutron diffusion equation for reactor applications. In order to follow the physics closely, energy group-dependent meshes are employed. We present a novel algorithm for assembling the terms coupling shape functions from different meshes and show how it can be made efﬁcient by deriving all meshes from a common coarse mesh by hierarchic reﬁnement. Our methods are formulated using conforming ﬁnite elements of any order, for any number of energy groups. The spatial error distribution is assessed with a generalization of an error estimator originally derived for the Poisson equation.},

Ritzprocedures are employedto yieldnodal methods that are analogous to those usedextensivelyin diffusiontheory, but without the need for ad-hoc node-to-node interpolation of transverse leakage terms. With spherical harmonics, nodal transport methods are obtained with consistent angular approximations within the nodes and across the node interfaces.The resulting equations are in response matrix form, and from their solution the detailed flux distribution as well as the node-averaged values can be obtained.},

	abstract = {The finite element method is a procedure for reducing partial differential equations to sets of simultaneous algebraic equations suitable for solution on a digital computer. The method consists of several steps. The differential equation first is cast into the form of a variational principle, and the domain of the resulting functional is partitioned into a number of subdomains or finite elements. The dependent variable then is approximated within each element by a simple polynomial, and these are linked across inter-element boundaries by appropriate continuity conditions. Such an approximation may be represented as a sum of piecewise polynomial trial functions with unknown coefficients that typically correspond to the values of the dependent variable and possibly its derivatives at mesh points defined by the finite element structure. The requirement that the functional be stationary with respect to variations in these coefficients then leads to the desired set of simultaneous equations.},
