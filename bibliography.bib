	abstract = {Numerical simulation of nuclear reactors is a key technology in the quest for improvements in efﬁciency, safety, and reliability of both existing and future reactor designs. Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-speciﬁc applications, all built on the same software framework, are efﬁciently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a ﬂexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simpliﬁed Westinghouse AP-1000 conﬁguration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shufﬂe.},

It is a part of international R\&D efforts lead by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) US project to improve the neutron-physics and thermal-fluid simulation of (high temperature gascooled reactors) HTGRs, one of the next generations of safer nuclear reactors. Accurate and validated analysis tools are indeed a crucial requirement for safety analysis and licensing of nuclear reactors. To guide this effort, a numerical benchmark on the MHTGR was created by the NGNP project and formally approved in 2012 for international participation by the OECD/NEA. The benchmark defines a common set of exercises and the comparison of solutions obtained with different analysis tools is expected to improve the understanding of simulation methods for HTGRs. The coupled neutronics/thermal-fluid solution presented in this paper was obtained with the neutron transport Monte Carlo code MCS developed by Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology and the thermal-fluid code GAMMA+ developed by Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute. The purpose of this paper is to present the GAMMA+/MCS coupled system, the calculation methodology, and the obtained solutions.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in the development of coarse-mesh nodal methods for the numerical solution of the neutron diffusionand transport equations is reviewed.In contrast with earlier nodal simulators, more recent nodal diffusionmethods are characterized by the systematicderivation of spatial coupling relationships that are entirely consistent with the multigroup diffusion equation. These relationships most often are derived by developing approximations to the one-dimensionalequations obtained by integrating the multidimensionaldiffusionequation over directions transverse to each coordinate axis. Both polynomial and analytic approaches to the solution of the transverse-integrated equations are discussed, and the Cartesian-geometry polynomial approach is derived in a manner which motivates the extension of this formulation to the solution of the diffusionequation in hexagonal geometry. Iterative procedures developed for the solution of the nodal equations are discussed briefly, and numerical comparisons for representative three-dimensional benchmark problems are given. The application of similar ideas to the neutron transport equation has led to the development of coarse-mesh transport schemes that combine nodal spatial approximations with angular representations based on either the standard discrete-ordinate approximation or double P, expansions of the angular dependenceof the fluxeson the surfaces of the nodes. The former methods yield improved difference approximations to the multidimensional discrete-ordinates equations, while the latter approach leads to equations similar to those obtained in interfacecurrent nodal-diffusionformulations. The relativeeflicienciesof these two approaches are discussed,and directions for future work are indicated.},

Expensive Jacobian matrix formation is alleviated via the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, and physics-based preconditioning is applied to minimize Krylov iterations. Motivation for the work is provided via analysis and numerical experiments on simpler multiphysics reactor models. We then provide detail of the physical models and numerical methods in PRONGHORN. Finally, PRONGHORN’s algorithmic capability is demonstrated on a number of PBR test cases.},

This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution ﬁelds than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

	abstract = {The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is tasked with the development of reactor physics analysis capability of the Next Generation Nuclear Power (NGNP) project. In order to examine the INL’s current prismatic reactor analysis tools, the project is conducting a benchmark exercise based on modeling the High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR). This exercise entails the development of a model for the initial criticality, a 19 fuel column thin annular core, and the fully loaded core critical condition with 30 fuel columns. Special emphasis is devoted to physical phenomena and artifacts in HTTR that are similar to phenomena and artifacts in the NGNP base design. The DRAGON code is used in this study since it offers significant ease and versatility in modeling prismatic designs. DRAGON can generate transport solutions via Collision Probability (CP), Method of Characteristics (MOC) and Discrete Ordinates (Sn). A fine group cross-section library based on the SHEM 281 energy structure is used in the DRAGON calculations. The results from this study show reasonable agreement in the calculation of the core multiplication factor with the MC methods, but a consistent bias of 2–3\% with the experimental values is obtained. This systematic error has also been observed in other HTTR benchmark efforts and is well documented in the literature. The ENDF/B VII graphite and U235 cross sections appear to be the main source of the error. The isothermal temperature coefficients calculated with the fully loaded core configuration agree well with other benchmark participants but are 40\% higher than the experimental values. This discrepancy with the measurement partially stems from the fact that during the experiments the control rods were adjusted to maintain criticality, whereas in the model, the rod positions were fixed. In addition, this work includes a brief study of a cross section generation approach that seeks to decouple the domain in order to account for neighbor effects. This spectral interpenetration is a dominant effect in annular HTR physics. This analysis methodology should be further explored in order to reduce the error that is systematically propagated in the traditional generation of cross sections.},
